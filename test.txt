# I Was Sad Because of You

You don't talk to me again, do you? I don't know what happened, but could you be fair to me?  

I know, some time I make you embarrass, some time I am boring. But it really hurt me that you don't talk to me.

**This is not fair.** I'm still your friend! **To say nothing always hurt the one who cares about you.** It make me doubt why you do that. It make me doubt myself.

I'm a sensitive person. I think that I can catch what you think in most time. Your every little actions are all in my eye.

***

I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being sad once a once again. **Please Don't Do It.** it really hurt me a lot. It's unfair to me.

> Even so, I will still by your side.
